      <strong>1. Express.js</strong>
      <p>
        Express.js is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It provides a comprehensive set of features for web and mobile applications, making it the backbone of our server-side development. Key features of Express include:

        Middleware: Use middleware to handle HTTP requests, manage sessions, and interact with databases.
        Routing: Define routes to handle different URL paths, allowing for efficient and scalable navigation.
        Flexibility: Easily integrate with various templating engines and other Node.js modules.

        2. EJS (Embedded JavaScript)


      </strong>

      <p>
        EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It integrates seamlessly with Express, allowing us to:
        Embed JavaScript: Write JavaScript code directly within HTML, providing dynamic content rendering.
        Reusable Components: Create reusable components to maintain a clean and organized codebase.
        Conditional Rendering: Render content conditionally based on logic, making our pages more interactive and user-friendly.
